## Datatypes

Data Type  | Description | Examples 
---- | ---- | ---- 
Integers | Whole Numbers | -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Floating-point numbers | Numbers with decimal point |  -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25
Strings | Ordered sequence of characters | 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'
List | Ordered sequence of objects | [10, "Hello", 20.3]
Dictonary | Unordered key : value pairs | {"MyKey" : "Value"}
Tuples | Ordered immutable sequence of objects | (10, "Hello, 20.3)
Set | Unordered collection of unique objects | {"a", "b"}
Bool | Logical value indicating True or False | True / False

## Operators

Operators  | Operation  | Example
---- | ---- | ---- 
`**` | Exponent | 2 ** 3 = 8
`%` | Modulus/Remaider | 22 % 8 = 6
`//` | Integer division | 22 // 8 = 2
`/` | Division | 22 / 8 = 2.75
`*`| Multiplication | 3 * 3 = 9
`-`| Subtraction | 5 - 2 = 3
`+`| Addition | 2 + 2 = 4

Examples of expressions in the interactive shell:

    >>> 2 + 3 * 6
    20

## Variables

## Comparison Operators

Used Example a = 3 and b = 4

Operators  | Operation  | Example
---- | ---- | ---- 
`>` | If the value of left operand is **greater than** the value of right operand, the condition becomes true | (a > b) -> False
`<` | If the value of left operand is **less than** the value of right operand, the condition becomes true. | (a < b) -> True
`==` | If the values of two operands are **equal**, then the condition becomes true.	| (a == b) -> False
`>=` | If the value of left operand is **greater than or equal** to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a >= b) -> False
`<=` | If the value of left operand is **less than or equal** to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a <= b) -> True
`!=` | If values of two operands are **not equal**, then condition becomes true. | (a != b) -> True

## If - elif - else statements

_Definition
if my_condition is equal a value:
    execute some code
elif my_other_condition is equal another value:
    execute something different
else:
    do something else_
    
```
mysite = "afab"
if mysite == "robot lab":
    print("It is part of the DesignFactory")
elif mysite == "afab":
    print("Coding is cool")
else:
    print("I do not know much")
```

`Coding is cool`
