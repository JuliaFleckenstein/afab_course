## Datatypes

Data Type  | Description | Examples 
---- | ---- | ---- 
Integers | Whole Numbers | -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Floating-point numbers | Numbers with decimal point |  -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25
Strings | Ordered sequence of characters | 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'
List | Ordered sequence of objects | [10, "Hello", 20.3]
Dictonary | Unordered key : value pairs | {"MyKey" : "Value"}
Tuples | Ordered immutable sequence of objects | (10, "Hello, 20.3)
Set | Unordered collection of unique objects | {"a", "b"}
Bool | Logical value indicating True or False | True / False

## Operators

Operators  | Operation  | Example
---- | ---- | ---- 
`**` | Exponent | 2 ** 3 = 8
`%` | Modulus/Remaider | 22 % 8 = 6
`//` | Integer division | 22 // 8 = 2
`/` | Division | 22 / 8 = 2.75
`*`| Multiplication | 3 * 3 = 9
`-`| Subtraction | 5 - 2 = 3
`+`| Addition | 2 + 2 = 4

Examples of expressions in the interactive shell:

    >>> 2 + 3 * 6
    20

## Variables

## Comparison Operators

Used Example a = 3 and b = 4

Operators  | Operation  | Example
---- | ---- | ---- 
`>` | If the value of left operand is **greater than** the value of right operand, the condition becomes true | (a > b) -> False
`<` | If the value of left operand is **less than** the value of right operand, the condition becomes true. | (a < b) -> True
`==` | If the values of two operands are **equal**, then the condition becomes true.	| (a == b) -> False
`>=` | If the value of left operand is **greater than or equal** to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a >= b) -> False
`<=` | If the value of left operand is **less than or equal** to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true. | (a <= b) -> True
`!=` | If values of two operands are **not equal**, then condition becomes true. | (a != b) -> True

## If - elif - else statements

Definition
```python
if my_condition is equal a value:
    execute some code
elif my_other_condition is equal another value:
    execute something different
else:
    do something else
```
    
Example
```python
mysite = "afab"
if mysite == "robot lab":
    print("It is part of the DesignFactory")
elif mysite == "afab":
    print("Coding is fun")
else:
    print("I do not know much")
```

`Coding is fun`


## While loop

Definition
* repeats statment(s) while a condition is TRUE
* requires an exit condition
```python
while some_boolean_condition:
    do something
else:
    do something different
```

Example
```python
break_condition = 0
while break_condition < 10:
    break_condition = break_condition + 1
    print(break_condition)
else:
    print("out of while loop")
```

## For loop

* iterating over items of a sequence (usually a list)
```python 
mylist = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
for jelly in mylist:
    print(jelly)
```
* iterating over numbers in range()
> The range() function can also be called with three arguments. The first two arguments will be the start and stop values, and the third will be the step argument. The step is the amount that the variable is increased by after each iteration: range(start, stop, step)
```python 
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```
* iterating over characters in a string
```python 
for letter in "Python":
    print("current letter: ", letter)
```  
* iterating over every key in a dictonary
```python 
d = {"k1":1, "k2":2, "k3":3}
for item in d:
    print(item)
```
* index in range
```python 
print(len(pets))
print(list(range(len(pets))))

for index in range(0,len(pets)):
    print(index, pets[index])
```    
* index and objects in list
```python 
for p,x in enumerate(pets):
    print(p, x)
```
* BREAK: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop
* CONTINUE: Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop
* PASS: Does nothing at all
```python 
while True:
    print('Who are you?')
    name = input()
    if name != 'Joe':
        continue
    print('Hello, Joe. What is the password? (It is a fish.)')
    password = input()
    if password == 'swordfish':
        break
print('Access granted.')
```

## Lists
* Unlike strings, they are mutable
* elements inside a list can be changed
```python 
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant']

>>> spam
['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']

>>> len(spam)
4
```
* Indexing
```python 
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant']

positive Index
>>> spam[2]
'2'
negative Index
>>> spam[-1]
'elephant'
```
* Slicing
```python 
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant']
>>> spam[0:4]
['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant']

>>> spam[1:3]
['bat', 3]

>>> spam[:2]
['cat', 'bat']
```
* Reassign
```python
>>> spam = spam + ['add new item']
>>> spam
['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant', 'add new item']
```
* Create a new list
```python
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant']
>>> spam.append('append me!!')

>>>spam
['cat', 'bat', 3, 'elephant', 'append me!!']
```
